## 🎯 Overview

Stealth Pitch Builder is a secure workflow tool that generates professional,
public-facing GitHub README files from private projects without exposing source code,
architecture details, or proprietary information. It uses AI-assisted generation
with multi-layer security validation to ensure safe documentation.


This repository provides a **professional showcase** of the platform's vision and capabilities.

⚠️ **All development, source code, and technical implementation remain strictly private and confidential.**
